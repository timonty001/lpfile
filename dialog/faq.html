    <h6>How is this different than all Clash Royale Hacks?</h6>
    <div>
        <p>This tool is most certainly not a Clash Royale Hack tool. There are a lot of cheats and hacks that claim to work by penetrating the supercell servers with some kind of hack method. This is a hack that is approved by the original developer and is allowed to exist in order to get free gems for clash royale</p>
        <p>Unlike all the hack tool generators that claim to work for unlimited amount of gold and gems, this hack can only give you a pre-chosen amount of gems for one time only.</p>
    </div>

    <h6>How can you provide free gems with no Hack?</h6>
    <div>
        <p>We are teamed up with the developers of the original game Clash Royale to give you a one time promotion of free gems.</p>
        <p>The reason for this is to stabilize the imbalances that were created since the start of Clash Royale. It seems like a lot of users were using hack tools at the beginning, but now their accounts are getting banned. So their gems had to be balanced out in the Supercell server.</p>
        <p>The hack for Clash Royale free gems is just a limited time deal only. There are a lot of paying users of Clash Royale as well so we don't want to get them mad. Hence why we will keep this promotion open until the game balances out.</p>
    </div>

    <h6>Why do you need my Clash Royale Player Tag/ID?</h6>
    <div>
        <p>This is the only way to make sure we send the resources to the right person. We certainly don't want to surprise other members and make them wonder where their gems came from.</p>
    </div>

    <h6>Why the need for Verification?</h6>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>There are a number of reasons why we need to keep these verifications in place. First and most important one is because hackers tend to abuse these kind of promos with specially designed bots for Clash Royale and get all the free gems to one Clash Royale account.</li>
            <li>Second we need to make sure it is really you. We would like to send over gems to wrong person for many reasons.</li>
            <li>And third it's to make sure everyone gets their cut. Sure you can do this more than one time, but it won't be easy to replicate.</li>
            <li>You should be proud to help us fight SPAM!</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <p>All the sponsors and affiliate related to this hack are completel legitimate busnisess who operate in USA or Europe. You can rest assured your data is 100% safe with them.</p>

    <h6>Can I skip surveys?</h6>
    <div>
        <p>Sure you can! The fastest way to get around the surveys is to select a PIN offer from the task list for verification. These are easy to do and 100% safe and guarantee you to unlock the free gems.</p>
    </div>

    <h6>I can't see the hack tool, is it a hack?</h6>
    <div>
