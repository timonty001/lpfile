    <h2 class="title-step">More on how to use this hack tool!</h2>
    <div class="step s-1">
        <h6>Choose the amount of resources.</h6>
        <p>Choose the amount of resources you want to receive from this hack by adjusting the Gems and Gold then click Get Free Gems button.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step s-2">
        <h6>Enter your Clash Royale Player Tag.</h6>
        <p>Please doublecheck the Player Tag you've entered. It's extremely important that you enter the correct Player Tag so this tool can generate free gems to your account. You can see your unique Player tag by pressing the icon profile on your home screen.</p>
        <p>Here is an example:</p>
        <img alt="player tag" src="img/playertag-example.html" />
    </div>

    <div class="step s-3">
        <h6>Paitently wait for the process to finish.</h6>
        <p>As soon as you enter your Player Tag and hit Get Free Gems the generator will start working on generating those free gems and gold into your Clash Royale account.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step s-4">
        <h6>Complete the verification.</h6>
        <p>A verification is needed in order to receive the free gems and gold into your Clash Royale account.</p>
        <p>A two-step verification is in place that you MUST complete in order to get into this hack. The chances of getting the resources(gems and gold) you have previously selected will be thin if you do not complete these important steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First you have to share this hack through any social media account with your friends. Whether that is Facebook, Twitter or Google+ the most important thing is to get the word out there. Don't be greedy, let your friends get some of these free gems</li>
            <li>Then you have to verify you're not a bot exploiting this hack. You will have to choose one task from a list and complete it with real info. These are some short quizes that usually ask you to enter your email or maybe phone number, but nothing too demanding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Warning:<br>The time for completing the verification steps is 15 minutes. It's enough time to pass it completely. This is necessary because the Supercell servers only allow us a token to last 15 minutes in order to generate free gems for Clash Royale</p>
        <p>What if you wait more than 15 minutes?<br>In case you fail to complete the verification task in 15 minutes you will have to start all over.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step s-5">
        <h6>Enjoy spending the free gems.</h6>
        <p>If all went well your gold and gems should be in your Clash Royale game. Sometimes the serves lag if there are too many users so please allow up to 24 hours so all requests can be processed</p>
